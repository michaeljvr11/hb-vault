# Vendor & Admin Portals

Spec for the two role-gated back-office surfaces on top of the existing
role-discriminated identity model. Front-of-funnel planning only — implementation
flows through `/ship-card`. Related: [[HB Domain Model]] · [[Auth & Roles]] ·
[[Listing Types & Vendor Rules]] · [[Order State Machine]] · [[Money & Currency Rules]].

## Problem

Customers can browse/shop today, but there is **no surface for vendors to run their
business** (list products, see their orders) and **no surface for admins to run the
platform** (approve vendors, oversee listings/users/orders). The data model and most
vendor/admin API endpoints already exist; what's missing is the portal UI and a few
backend gaps (vendor order/fulfilment, admin oversight, dashboard read-models).

## Architecture decisions (confirmed with the user, 2026-06-18)

1. **Identity stays on the single role-discriminated `users` table** (`customer | vendor
   | admin`). No separate admin store. A vendor's business profile remains the existing
   `vendors` row, `OneToOne` to the user via `userId`. See [[Auth & Roles]].
2. **One NestJS monolith.** Reuse the settled `@Roles` / global `RolesGuard` + the
   service-layer ownership pattern. No microservices, no new auth flow.
3. **Frontend = lazy-loaded, role-gated route areas inside `apps/web`** — `/vendor/**`
   (`roleGuard(['vendor'])`) and `/admin/**` (`roleGuard(['admin'])`), each with its own
   shell/layout component. **Not** separate apps or subdomains. Subdomains remain a
   later deployment option requiring zero data-model change (same registrable domain keeps
   the refresh cookie working — see [[Auth & Roles]] SameSite note).
4. **Sequencing: vendor portal first.** Admin **vendor-approvals** is its gating
   dependency (a vendor can't transact until an admin approves them).

## Business rules it must honour

From [[Listing Types & Vendor Rules]] and [[Auth & Roles]] — enforce, don't reinvent:

- **Only `approved` vendors can list products or receive orders.** Lifecycle:
  `pending → approved` (↘ `rejected`); `approved → suspended` (and back). Status changes
  are **admin-only**.
- **Vendor-facing queries MUST filter by ownership** — a vendor sees only their own
  listings/orders. Ownership checks live in the **service layer**, never hand-rolled in
  controllers.
- **Listing-type invariant:** vendors create `vendor` listings (must have a `vendorId`);
  admins create `platform` listings (must not). DB CHECK already enforces this; don't
  bypass it.
- **Admin scope:** manage categories, platform listings, vendor approval/suspension, and
  **all** orders. Vendor scope: own profile, own listings, own order lines.
- Money stays `numeric(12,2)` + explicit currency; ZAR/NAD peg is data. Dashboard
  aggregates that sum money get a unit test. See [[Money & Currency Rules]].

## What already exists (do NOT re-build)

- **Vendor API:** full CRUD, `POST /vendors` (self-onboard), `POST /vendors/admin`,
  `PATCH /vendors/:id/status` (approve/reject/suspend), `GET /vendors` (admin list),
  `GET /vendors/me`. (`apps/api/src/vendors/vendors.controller.ts`)
- **Products API:** vendor/admin create with ownership-scoped edit/delete; public read.
- **Categories API:** admin CRUD.
- **Auth/guards:** `JwtAuthGuard` + `RolesGuard` + `@Roles`/`@Public`; web `authGuard` +
  `roleGuard` (reads `route.data.roles`). Vendor route already scaffolded (commented) in
  `apps/web/src/app/app.routes.ts`.
- **Design:** a `vendor-dashboard` screen is already pulled under `docs/design/`.

## Backend gaps to fill

- **Vendor orders / fulfilment:** `orders` currently exposes only customer `GET /orders`
  (`getMyOrders`). Need vendor-scoped read of the `order_items` belonging to the vendor +
  the confirmed fulfilment transitions (`confirmed→processing`, `processing→handed_to_hb`).
  See [[Order State Machine]] for the full confirmed transition table.
- **New `handed_to_hb` OrderStatus:** a new enum value in `@hb/shared` + migration is
  required (see [[Order State Machine]]).
- **Admin module:** no consolidated `admin/` module. Admin user-management (list/search,
  activate/deactivate, role assignment) and cross-cutting order oversight have no home.
- **Dashboard read-models:** aggregate endpoints for vendor dashboard (own counts, recent
  orders, revenue) and admin dashboard (pending-vendor count, totals).
- **Admin bootstrap endpoint:** `POST /auth/bootstrap-admin` — self-sealing (refuses if
  any admin already exists). Accepts `email` + `password`, creates the first admin user.
  Callable from Bruno. Must have a unit test verifying it refuses on the second call.

- **Audit log:** new `audit_logs` entity (`id`, `userId`, `action`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `metadata` JSONB, `createdAt`) + TypeORM migration. A shared `AuditService.log()` helper called from service methods on key actions: vendor status changes, order transitions, user role/activation changes, product create/edit/delete, admin bootstrap. Admin-gated `GET /admin/audit-logs` with filtering by action, entityType, userId, and date range + pagination.

## `@hb/shared` contract impact

Interfaces + enums only; API DTOs `implement` them; web consumes them. Likely additions
(confirm exact shape per slice):

- `enums/order-status.ts`: add `handed_to_hb` value.
- `contracts/order.ts`: vendor-scoped order/line view DTO; vendor fulfilment status-update
  request DTO (only `confirmed→processing` and `processing→handed_to_hb` allowed).
- `contracts/user.ts`: admin user-list item + update-role / set-active request DTO.
- New `contracts/dashboard.ts`: vendor + admin dashboard summary DTOs.
- Vendor contracts already cover onboarding/status (`CreateVendorRequest`,
  `AdminCreateVendorRequest`, `UpdateVendorStatusRequest`). Reuse — don't duplicate.

Every new endpoint input = a class-validator DTO implementing the shared interface.

- `contracts/audit.ts` (new): `AuditLogDto` (`id`, `userId`, `action`, `entityType`, `entityId`, `metadata`, `createdAt`); `AuditLogQueryDto` for filter params (`action?`, `entityType?`, `userId?`, `from?`, `to?`, `page`, `limit`).

## Resolved decisions (2026-06-18)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Who can trigger which order transition? | Admin: all. Vendor (own lines only): `confirmed→processing`, `processing→handed_to_hb`. HB/admin then handles `handed_to_hb→shipped→delivered`. |
| Vendor onboarding depth for v1? | No document upload. Existing `CreateVendorRequest` fields are sufficient. `verificationDocumentUrl` stays optional, KYC deferred. |
| Admin bootstrap? | One-shot `POST /auth/bootstrap-admin` endpoint — refuses if any admin exists (self-sealing), returns a normal auth response. Callable from Bruno. |

| Audit log type? | Activity trail stored in a new `audit_logs` DB table. Capture: vendor status changes, order transitions, user role/activation changes, product edits, admin bootstrap. Not application/error logs. |

## Out of scope (separate cards / TBD)

- KYC / banking / verification-document review — deferred past v1 per [[Listing Types & Vendor Rules]].
- Commission & fee structure, vendor cross-border self-fulfilment — TBD.
- Splitting admin into its own `apps/admin` / subdomain — deferred deployment option.
- Real payment/courier providers (ports + stubs stay stubs without an explicit card).
- Order-placement gate on `isVerified` — already its own (blocked) card #15.
- Cancellation after `processing`, partial shipment/delivery — still TBD in [[Order State Machine]].

## Open questions (remaining)

- Cancellation policy after `processing` — who can cancel, any restocking fee?
- Mixed-line orders where one vendor ships and another hasn't — how does order status aggregate?

## Vertical slices (→ Trello cards)

**Vendor portal (first)**
1. Vendor route area + shell/layout + `roleGuard(['vendor'])`.
2. Vendor dashboard screen wired to a vendor-summary read-model endpoint.
3. Vendor product management UI.
4. Vendor orders & fulfilment — `GET /orders/vendor` + `confirmed→processing` + `processing→handed_to_hb` transitions.
5. Vendor onboarding UI — "become a vendor" → `POST /vendors` (no doc upload in v1).

**Admin portal**
6. Admin route area + shell/layout + `roleGuard(['admin'])` + **admin bootstrap endpoint**.
7. Vendor approvals (keystone) — gating dependency for vendor portal.
8. Admin catalog (platform listings) + category management UI.
9. Admin user management — `admin/` module: list/search, activate/deactivate, role assign.
10. Admin order oversight + dashboard metrics.
11. Admin audit log — `audit_logs` table + `AuditService` + admin UI to view/filter the activity trail.

## Implementation notes

### Admin portal foundation — shell + bootstrap endpoint — 2026-06-18 (card AP-6 / Z1ADCLQm)

**Backend — `POST /auth/bootstrap-admin`** (`@Public`): self-sealing one-time admin seed. Counts admins via new `UsersService.countByRole`; returns **409 Conflict** once any admin exists. Cannot be re-exploited. On success creates an admin user with `isVerified: true` (trusted setup action, exempt from order-gating verification) and returns the normal auth response — access token + httpOnly refresh cookie, identical to `/auth/login`. New shared contract `BootstrapAdminRequest`; `BootstrapAdminDto implements` it with class-validator `IsEmail` and `MinLength(8)`. Password hashed by the `User` `@BeforeInsert` hook like register. Bruno request "Bootstrap Admin" added for one-click first-time setup. Unit test asserts the 409-on-second-call gate (non-negotiable), admin creation, and email-collision (400).

**Frontend — `/admin` route area**: lazy, `canActivate: [authGuard, roleGuard]`, `data: { roles: ['admin'] }` — unauthenticated and non-admin users are redirected to `/login` by the existing guards. Standalone signals-based, SSR-safe `AdminShell` (sticky top bar with H&B Market wordmark + "Admin Console" badge + sign-out; sidebar nav: Dashboard / Vendors / Catalog / Users / Orders / Logs with active-link highlight; `<router-outlet>` for children). Six lazy placeholder child pages; default child redirects to `dashboard`. Styled to the `admin-dashboard` Claude Design tokens; three new tokens registered in `docs/design/DESIGN.md` (`--hb-secondary-fixed`, `--hb-on-secondary-container`, `--hb-scrim`).

**No schema change** — `users.role` and `users.isVerified` already exist.

**Tests/review:** api 25/25, web 46/46, lint clean, full build clean. Code review: SHIP, no FAIL items (design-token nits addressed).

**Follow-ups:** real admin screens replace the placeholders in later AP cards (AP-7 vendor approvals is next — the keystone).

### Vendor portal foundation — route area + shell — 2026-06-19 (card VP-1 / EXPtZCJL)

**Frontend only** — no backend changes. Uncommented and completed the `/vendor` lazy route in `apps/web/src/app/app.routes.ts`: `canActivate: [authGuard, roleGuard]`, `data: { roles: ['vendor'] }`, `loadComponent: () => VendorShell`, with four lazy child routes (`''` redirects to `dashboard`, plus `dashboard`, `products`, `orders`, `profile`).

New standalone signals-based `VendorShell` component at `apps/web/src/app/features/vendor/vendor-shell/` — mirrors the merged `AdminShell` pattern exactly: sticky top bar with H&B Market wordmark + "Vendor Portal" badge + sign-out button; sidebar nav (Dashboard / Products / Orders / Profile) with active-link highlight; `sidebarOpen` signal + toggle/close on nav; `<router-outlet>` for child routes. SSR-safe — no browser APIs, only signals.

Four lazy placeholder pages under `apps/web/src/app/features/vendor/pages/` (dashboard, products, orders, profile) — each returns "Coming soon" so child routes resolve without errors and later screens can swap in without route changes.

Vitest spec mirrors `admin-shell.spec.ts`: renders shell, validates four nav labels + paths, verifies sidebar toggle/close, confirms signOut calls `AuthService.logout()`.

Non-vendor roles (`customer`, `admin`) and unauthenticated users are already redirected to `/login` by the existing `authGuard` + `roleGuard` — no new guard code needed.

**Tests/build:** `npm run test -w @hb/web` 72/72 pass; `npm run lint:api` clean; `npm run build` (SSR) full pass. Code review verdict: **SHIP**, no FAIL items.

**Out of scope (deferred):** real vendor dashboard/products/orders/profile screens, vendor-summary read-model endpoint, design polish, vendor onboarding flow (VP-5).

### Vendor approvals (keystone) — 2026-06-19 (card AP-7 / DD6Z0NUW)

**Backend (`@hb/shared` + API).** The admin approvals UI needs onboarding fields the public `VendorResponseDto` deliberately hides. Added `AdminVendorDto extends VendorDto` to `@hb/shared` (adds `registrationNumber?`, `website?`, `description?`, `verificationDocumentUrl?`, `appliedAt`). New `AdminVendorResponseDto implements AdminVendorDto` on the API. `VendorsService.findAll()` (the admin-only `GET /vendors`) now returns the richer shape via a new `toAdminResponseDto` mapper; `appliedAt` is `createdAt.toISOString()`. The public `GET /vendors/directory` and `GET /vendors/:id` stay on the lean `VendorResponseDto`, so registration numbers / verification docs never leak to non-admins. **No schema change** — every field already exists on the `vendors` entity.

**Frontend.** Replaced the `admin/vendors` placeholder with the real keystone screen (`apps/web/src/app/features/admin/pages/admin-vendors/`): status filter tabs (All / Pending / Approved / Rejected / Suspended), a vendor list, and a detail panel (business/trading name, registration number, country, applied date, and `verificationDocumentUrl` as a link only when present). Status lifecycle is enforced in the UI by a pure, unit-tested `vendorActionsFor(status)` helper so only valid transitions are offered (pending→approve/reject, approved→suspend, suspended→re-approve, rejected→none); actions call `PATCH /vendors/:id/status` and update local signal state in place. Standalone, signals, new control flow, SSR-safe, styled to DESIGN.md tokens. `VendorsService.list()` retyped to `AdminVendorDto[]`.

**Tests/review:** api 30/30, web 86/86, lint clean, full SSR build pass. Code review verdict **SHIP** — two WARNs fixed in-PR (honoured the `appliedAt: string` contract by dropping a dead null-guard; swapped a hardcoded error-banner hex for `--hb-error` + `color-mix`) plus a double-submit guard test.

**Follow-ups:** unblocks real end-to-end vendor-portal testing. Document upload / KYC review still deferred (future card). Next admin card: AP-8 admin catalog.
